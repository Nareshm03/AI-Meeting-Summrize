Project Title: Intelligent Meeting Summarizer with Action Item Detection, Sentiment & Timeline Analysis Project Description: The Intelligent Meeting Summarizer is an AI-driven web application designed to transform raw meeting transcripts or recordings into clear, concise, and actionable insights â€” all while providing deeper context through sentiment analysis, speaker attribution, and interactive visualizations. Unlike basic summarization tools, this platform combines state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP), Speech-to-Text, and Topic Modeling to automatically generate human-like summaries, extract action items with priority estimation, analyze meeting sentiment, and visualize the entire conversation timeline. Additional features like sensitive information detection and ready-to-send email draft generation make this tool stand out as a comprehensive productivity and compliance assistant. Built with scalability and practical usability in mind, this project reflects real-world AI application skills suitable for modern workplaces, remote teams, and academic collaboration.
